# GroovyMail
GroovyMail aims to replace using JavaMail as the API to send email in Groovy by building a domain specific language (DSL) on top of JavaMail to make sending email simpler.  GroovyMail combines Groovy Templates and MarkupEngine to make sending rich email much easiser that using JavaMail alone.
